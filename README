## Features
- Real-time data acquisition
- Data processing and analysis
- User-friendly interface
- High accuracy and reliability

## Requirements
- PlatformIO Core
- Compatible microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, ESP32)
- Required sensors and modules

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/scimed_project.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd scimed_project
    ```
3. Open the project with PlatformIO:
